# Varied 
Over 60,000 different emoticons to choose from. Anything from rage 凸(⊙▂⊙✖) to delight (/◕ヮ◕)/,
from comfort (~ ‾⌣‾)~ to ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 


Huge thanks to author of this [repository](https://github.com/ekohrt/emoticon_kaomoji_dataset) for saving me the effort of compiling a list of emoticons myself :D
